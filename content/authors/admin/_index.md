I'm a PhD student at the Hebrew University, advised by Prof. Shmuel Peleg and Prof. Gil Segev. I am interested in the security of machine learning and the intersection between machine learning and cryptography. I study the security of ML systems from an adversarial perspective, and attempt to understand the extent of different threat models. From the cryptographic perspective, I am interested in understanding the role of ML systems and tools in solving cryptographic tasks, and the use of existing cryptographic techniques for increasing the trustworthiness of ML systems. 

In summer 2022 I was fortunate to visit the CleverHans lab at the Vector AI institute, and work with Prof. Nicolas Papernot on adversarial machine learning. More recently, in summer 2023 I was lucky to visit Cornell Tech and work with Prof. Tom Ristenpart on interplay between machine learning and cryptography.
